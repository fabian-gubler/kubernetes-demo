# Kubernetes Demo

## Objectives

Learn the fundamentals of the most popular container orchestrator in the world:
Kubernetes. I'll get your hands dirty and deploy Kubernetes applications,
pods, services and even ingress. I'll set up real
systems, but we'll also cover the theory, concepts and use cases of the
technology.
